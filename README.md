# birdies-ammo
 The official repository for the mod "Birdies' Ammo" for Forts on the Steam workshop.
 
You are allowed to upload your own version of Birdies Ammo to the Forts steam workshop or copy anything from this mod for use on the Forts Steam workshop.
Usage of assets outside of the Forts Steam workshop is prohibited.
 
 To get sound working in the mod, download FMOD studio version 2.2.8 and import the project folder "AmmoEverywhere/.dev/birdiesammo2.2".
 Delete the master bank, create a new master bank, and re-assign the sound events to that bank.
 Then "Build" the bank (F7), and copy the .bank files into AmmoEverywhere/audio/
 
 Alternatively, if you don't want to use FMOD studio, the sound files are in AmmoEverywhere/.dev/birdiesammo2.2/Assets/
 
Changing the "sb" prefixes in the mod will also be appreciated for maxium compatibility.
